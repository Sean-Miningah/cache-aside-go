## Cache Aside Implementation with Redis and PostgreSQL
This GoLang project demonstrates the implementation of the Cache Aside pattern using Redis as the caching layer and PostgreSQL as the backend database.

### Overview
Cache Aside, also known as Lazy Loading or Lazy Population, is a caching pattern that allows an application to load data from the cache on demand, updating the cache with fresh data from the database when necessary. In this project, we utilize Redis as an in-memory cache to improve the performance of data retrieval operations.

Features
* __Cache Aside Pattern__: Efficiently manages data caching by retrieving from Redis cache when available, otherwise fetching from PostgreSQL database and updating the cache.
* __Redis Integration__: Utilizes Redis as a caching layer to store frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database server.
* __PostgreSQL Database__: Utilizes PostgreSQL for persistent data storage, ensuring data integrity and durability.
